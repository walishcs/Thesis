\chapter{Issues in Proto-Seediq lexical reconstruction} \label{ch6}

In this chapter, I will introduce a unique doublet phenomenon found in \acl{psed} and contemporary dialects, along with its potential connection to the ``Gender Register System'' in the Atayal language (see \cite{li1980gender,li1982gender,li1983gender,goderich2020phd}). Additionally, external evidence for the reconstruction of some \acl{psed} words will also be discussed in this section.
