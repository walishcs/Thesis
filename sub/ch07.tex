\chapter{Seediq subgrouping}\label{ch7}

In this section, I will propose a subgrouping hypothesis of Seediq dialects mainly based on shared phonological innovations. The historical development of \acl{psed} *ə plays an important role in this subgrouping. Lexical evidence will be used as well, especially those contains sporadic sound change and those with replacement of the whole lexical item. 

\subsection{Subgrouping hypothesis}

The subgrouping of Seediq dialects based on the phonological and lexical evidence is presented in Figure \ref{fig:qhuni}.

There is a subgroup of Toda-Truku, which is consisted of \acl{cto}, \acl{eto}, \acl{ctr}, and \acl{etr}. Moreover, \acl{cto} and \acl{eto} form a Toda subgroup; while \acl{ctr} and \acl{etr} form a Truku subgroup under Toda-Truku. 

\acl{tg} is thus divided as the other primary branch since there is no further evidence to link \acl{tg} with the other dialects for now. On the other hand, \acl{tg} itself has some phonological change which are very unique among Seediq dialects, especially the historical penultimate schwa *ə shift to /e/ in penultimate syllable and the pre-penultimate *ə shift to /u/ as the ``neutralized/reduced'' vowel. That is, Tgdaya is considered a primary offspring of \acl{psed}.
